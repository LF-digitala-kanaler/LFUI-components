# LFUI

LFUI is a HTML-, CSS- and JS framework built on top of Bootstrap to be used in Länsförsäkringar's different applications and websites. LFUI has restyled many of Bootstrap's native components as well as included new ones specific for Länsförsäkringar, along with other custom features and utilities.
