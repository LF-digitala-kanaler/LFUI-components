# Popover tooltip <Badges of={PopoverStories} />

<Canvas
    of={PopoverStories.Default}
    story={{inline:false, height: 250}}
/>

The popover is triggered on both click and hover.

Use the popover-tooltip to allow the user to toggle explanations to difficult words, or words not considered general knowledge. Works great inline! Also included is an option to link to a dictionary containing all the difficult words gathered from your application within the popover itself.

The popover-tooltip extends on the popover class, and is triggered by wrapping the word needing an explanation in a `popover-tooltip-trigger` class, and also pointing to the toggleable div with `aria-controls="[div id]"`. The div should have an id corresponding to the one specified in the aria-controls. Add the `popover-tooltip` to the div, along with any popover classes to manipulate its positioning. Make sure the entire popover-tooltip is wrapped in the `popover-tooltip-trigger` element.

Like popovers, we need some simple triggering javascript in order for the popover to appear.

```javascript
$('.popover-tooltip-trigger').on('focus blur', function() {
  $('#' + $(this).attr('aria-controls')).parent().toggleClass('open');
});
```

## Center popup box on small screens
There is an option to center the popup box on smaller screens. If you add `popover-sm-center` to both `popover-tooltip-trigger` and popover-tooltip the box will be centered on small screens right aligned on wider.

<Canvas
    of={PopoverStories.Centered}
    story={{inline:false, height: 250}}
/>
