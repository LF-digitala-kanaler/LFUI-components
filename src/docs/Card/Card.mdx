It's not much to say about our Card component. It's built using Bootstrap's card component. Please see Bootstrap card for full details on this use of the component.

You can basically put anything you want inside `.card-block`. We do have some classes to help you with the styling, `.card-title` will give you the heading look, you can use `.card-text` if you don't want the text to fill the card's width( it has a max-width on it).

```html
<article class="card">
	<img class="card-img-top" src="http://placehold.it/800x640/ffffff" alt="Card image cap" />
	<div class="card-block">
		<h3 class="card-title"></h3>
		<p class="card-text"></p>
	</div>
	<div class="card-footer"></div>
</article>
```

## Card deck

There is a couple of helpers classes to keep in mind. If you have cards in a row and you want them to have equal height you can wrap them with `.card-deck`

<Canvas of={CardStories.CardDeck} />

## Clickable Card

Sometimes you want your Card to be a link that can be done jsut adding a link inside your card with the class `.link-complex`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CardLink} />
