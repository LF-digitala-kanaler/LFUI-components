## Accessibility

- A nav with `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
- The set of links is structured using an ordered list
- To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are added via CSS
- `aria-current="page"` is applied to the last link in the set to indicate that it represents the current page.
