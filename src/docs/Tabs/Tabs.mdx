## Setting theme
Themes are used to modify Nav styles for a desired background color. See how the hover color for Line Tabs changes from white to blue on a white background.

The theme is best applied to a containing element – likely the same element that applies the background color – with the `data-bs-theme="on-gray"` class. Tabs currently support on-gray and on-white.

```html
<div class="bg-body-bg" data-bs-theme="on-gray">
  <div class="nav-tabs">…</div>
</div>
```

## Accessibility
If using a nav bar, add a role="navigation" to the most logical parent container of the `<ul>` or wrap a `<nav>` element around the navigation. Don't add the role to the `<ul>` as this will prevent it from being announced as a list by assistive technologies.

Note that navigation bars - even if styled as tabs with the `.nav-tabs` class - should not have `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, or `role="tabpanel"` attributes. See (this soruce) for more information.
