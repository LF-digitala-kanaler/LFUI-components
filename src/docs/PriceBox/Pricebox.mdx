# Pricebox <Badges of={PriceBoxStories} />

<Subtitle>
The Price-box component is used in forms, usually as (or inside of) a sidebar which lets the user keep track of the price/cost of the service as he/she makes changes in the form.
</Subtitle>

The component has some fixed classes in order to style the upper part (`.price-box-header`) of the component correctly.

The lower part (`.price-box-content`) contains a listing of all the factors that affect the price itself, which vary a great deal between forms. Feel free to use different types of LFUI components freely here depending on the form related to the price-box in question.

<Canvas of={PriceBoxStories.Desktop} />

<Note>
## Accesibility
It is important that pricebox is codewise placed before the primary button (= submit) of the main flow so that people who use screen readers get access to the information if they are tabbing through the page.
</Note>

## Variations
The price box (desktop variant) is not suitable for smaller views. Because of this there is two different variation you will have to show/hide depending on the screen width(screen width less than 768px show responsive variation).

### Responsive

<Canvas of={PriceBoxStories.FixedBottom} story={{inline: false, height: 300}} />

In smaller devices we use a position: fixed-oriented, collapsible price box instead to save space but still keep the easily overviewed component close at hand for the user. The `.price-box-bottom` is positioned in the bottom of the window so that only the header is visible, and on click it toggles upwards, showing the main content.

#### Content before the pricebox
You can make the content be displayed before the pricebox when expanded:

<Canvas of={PriceBoxStories.FixedTop} story={{inline: false, height: 300}} />

### Getting it interactive
We don't provide any specific Javascript for toggeling the responsive version, instead, we rely on the Bootstrap `data-bs-toggle="collapse"`. Please see the example implementations.
