Collapse uses the built in collapse functionality from Bootstrap. You can use a link with the href attribute, or a button with the `data-target` attribute. In both cases, the `data-bs-toggle="collapse"` is required.

Your hidden container will need an ID that matches that that-target or href.

## Variants
There is 2 different versions of collapse, one where the expanded area have a white background and one with grey background.

White is the default. To add a grey background, add `.bg-body-bg` to your collapse target like this:

<Canvas of={CollapseStories.WithGrayBackground} />

## Accessibility
Be sure to add aria-expanded to the control element. This attribute explicitly conveys the current state of the collapsible element tied to the control to screen readers and similar assistive technologies. If the collapsible element is closed by default, the attribute on the control element should have a value of `aria-expanded="false"`.

If you’ve set the collapsible element to be open by default using the show class, set aria-expanded="true" on the control instead. The plugin will automatically toggle this attribute on the control based on whether or not the collapsible element has been opened or closed (via JavaScript, or because the user triggered another control element also tied to the same collapsible element). If the control element’s HTML element is not a button (e.g., an `<a>`or `<div>`), the attribute `role="button"` should be added to the element.

If your control element is targeting a single collapsible element – i.e. the data-target attribute is pointing to an id selector – you should add the aria-controls attribute to the control element, containing the id of the collapsible element. Modern screen readers and similar assistive technologies make use of this attribute to provide users with additional shortcuts to navigate directly to the collapsible element itself.
