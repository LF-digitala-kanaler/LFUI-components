<p>The <a href="#">Länsförsäkringar Alliance</a> is unique in the Swedish bank and insurance market. The 23 customer-owned regional insurance companies cooperate, thereby combining the ability of a small company to adapt to its customers with the <strong>strength of a large company</strong>.</p>
<p>All of the companies have a strong local base in their individual home markets and have no ownership interests other than those of their own customers. Everything developed in the form of products, concepts and system support is based <em>exclusively</em> on customer needs.</p>
