# Pagination <Badges of={PaginationStories} />

<Subtitle>
	Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available
	links.
</Subtitle>

## Variations

There is two variations of pagination. One built with links which you can navigate back in and one built without links which you can't navigate in.

## Links

<Canvas of={PaginationStories.Default} />

Use a wrapping `<nav>` element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies. n addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it’s advisable to provide a descriptive aria-label for the `<nav>` to reflect its purpose.

### Without Links

<Canvas of={PaginationStories.NoInteractive} />

## Modifiers

### Stretchy

Using `pagination-flex` class on the pagination will make it stretch out to its full length.

<Canvas of={PaginationStories.Stretchy} />

<Note>
	### Small screens Pagination should be stretchy on small screens. There is no built in support in
	the component for that. However there is a class `pagination-sm-flex` you can add to make it work.
	<Canvas of={PaginationStories.StretchySmallScreen} />
</Note>

### Accessibility(Link variation)

For sighted users, it’s clear that the numbers will help him navigating different pages. But for an AT user, it’s completely different. By using aria-label, we can add a label to each link, so instead of hearing the screen reader saying Link, 1 it will be Link, Goto Page 1 .

To indicate which element is active, we need to tweak the value of `aria-label` by something like Page 3, Current page . Also, we will use `aria-current=true` for that.
