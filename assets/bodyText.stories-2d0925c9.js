  The
  <a href="#" onclick="return false">Länsförsäkringar Alliance</a>
  is unique in the Swedish bank and insurance market. The 23 customer-owned
  regional insurance companies cooperate, thereby combining the ability of a
  small company to adapt to its customers with the
  <strong>strength of a large company.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  All of the companies have a strong local base in their individual home markets
  and have no ownership interests other than those of their own customers.
  Everything developed in the form of products, concepts and system support is
  based
  <em>exclusively</em>
  on customer needs.
